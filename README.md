# Table-Sorter
This is a program designed to sort entries that are read from a file.
Sorting can be done on any column that exists in the table.
It does not use encryption, and it is not intended for database use.
The file in question has a format (read the bin/Release/readme.txt file for more info) that the data of a given file should have.
The sorter class lets the programmer create and use their own function for sorting.
